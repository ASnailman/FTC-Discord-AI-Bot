HOW TO USE (If you want to make changes)

Step 1: Make a python virtual environment

This is to avoid version conflicts with system. You want to download all the libraries from the 
requirements.txt file in the virtual environment.

In the terminal:
    1. [python -m venv venv] or [python -m venv venv]
    2. pip install -r "requirements.txt"
